      "message": "# The Pythagorean Theorem\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem is one of the most fundamental relationships in geometry. It describes the connection between the three sides of a right triangle.\n\n## The Basic Formula\n\nFor any right triangle (a triangle with a 90\u00b0 angle):\n```\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n```\nwhere:\n- **a** and **b** are the lengths of the two legs (the sides that form the right angle)\n- **c** is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle)\n\n## Visual Explanation\n\nImagine a right triangle:\n- The two sides forming the right angle might be 3 units and 4 units\n- According to the theorem: 3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n- So: 9 + 16 = 25\n- Therefore: c = 5\n\nThis means the hypotenuse must be 5 units long.\n\n## Practical Examples\n\n1. **Finding the distance across a field**\n   If you walk 30 meters east and then 40 meters north, how far are you from your starting point?\n   - East distance (a) = 30 m\n   - North distance (b) = 40 m\n   - Direct distance (c) = \u221a(30\u00b2 + 40\u00b2) = \u221a(900 + 1600) = \u221a2500 = 50 meters\n\n2. **Construction**\n   Builders use the \"3-4-5 rule\" (a simplified version) to ensure corners are square (90\u00b0) by measuring 3 units on one side, 4 on another, and confirming the diagonal is 5 units.\n\n## Historical Significance\n\nWhile named after the Greek mathematician Pythagoras (570-495 BCE), evidence suggests this relationship was known to the Babylonians and Egyptians over a thousand years earlier!\n\nWould you like to see more examples or learn about some interesting applications of the Pythagorean theorem?",
