# Progress: SelfPlay

## What Works

### Core Functionality
1. âœ… **Chatbot Creation**: Users can create chatbot instances with custom names and system messages.
2. âœ… **Self-Chat**: Bots can engage in self-chat, maintaining context across multiple turns.
3. âœ… **Bot Interaction**: Two different bots can interact with each other for a specified number of turns.
4. âœ… **Memory Management**: Conversation history is maintained and can be used for context in responses.
5. âœ… **Azure OpenAI Integration**: The system successfully integrates with Azure OpenAI for generating responses.
6. âœ… **HTML Export**: Conversations can be exported as formatted HTML files.
7. âœ… **Role Templates**: Predefined templates for common conversation scenarios are available.
8. âœ… **Error Handling**: Basic error handling for API calls and file operations is implemented.
9. âœ… **Logging**: System events and errors are logged for debugging purposes.
10. âœ… **Auto-End Detection**: Conversations can automatically end when they reach a natural conclusion.

### Documentation
1. âœ… **README**: Basic usage instructions and examples are provided.
2. âœ… **Memory Bank**: Comprehensive project documentation has been established.
3. âœ… **Code Comments**: Key functions and classes have descriptive comments.

## Current Status

The project is in a **stable, functional state** with all core features implemented. It can be used for its primary purposes of simulating conversations between bots and facilitating self-chat. The code is organized in a modular fashion, making it maintainable and extensible.

The memory bank has been initialized with comprehensive documentation of the project's architecture, design decisions, and future directions.

## Known Issues

1. **Token Limits**: For very long conversations, the token limit of the API may be reached, causing truncation of context.
2. **Error Recovery**: While errors are caught and logged, the system may not always recover gracefully from certain API failures.
3. **Template Flexibility**: The current template system is static and doesn't allow for easy user customization.
4. **API Dependency**: The system is currently tightly coupled with Azure OpenAI, limiting flexibility.
5. **Memory Persistence**: In-memory storage means conversation history is lost when the program terminates unless explicitly saved.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Design Decisions
1. **Azure OpenAI Integration**: The decision to use Azure OpenAI was based on its reliability and feature set, though it does create a dependency.
2. **In-Memory Storage**: For simplicity and performance, conversation history is stored in memory by default.
3. **Template-Based Design**: Templates were introduced to make common scenarios easy to set up without extensive configuration.
4. **Modular Architecture**: The separation of concerns between Chatbot, RolePlay, and Templates modules was established early to promote maintainability.

### Refinements and Adjustments
1. **Error Handling Improvements**: As the project evolved, more comprehensive error handling was added, particularly around API calls.
2. **Memory Management Options**: Methods for saving and loading memory were added to provide persistence options.
3. **HTML Export Format**: The decision to use HTML for exports was made to provide a readable, formatted output that could be easily viewed in a browser.
4. **Auto-End Detection**: Added the ability to automatically detect when a conversation has naturally concluded, rather than requiring a fixed number of turns.

### Future Direction Considerations
1. **API Abstraction Layer**: To reduce dependency on Azure OpenAI, an abstraction layer could be introduced to support multiple providers.
2. **Database Integration**: For applications requiring persistent memory across sessions, database integration could be beneficial.
3. **Dynamic Templates**: A more flexible template system could allow users to create and share their own templates.
4. **Analysis Tools**: Tools for analyzing conversation patterns could provide valuable insights for researchers and developers.
