# Active Context: SelfPlay

## Current Work Focus

The SelfPlay project is currently in a stable state with core functionality implemented. The primary focus areas are:

1. **Memory Bank Initialization**: Setting up comprehensive documentation to track the project's state, decisions, and future directions.

2. **Package Stability**: Ensuring the core functionality works reliably across different use cases and scenarios.

3. **Documentation**: Improving documentation to make the package more accessible to new users and contributors.

## Recent Changes

1. **Memory Bank Creation**: Established a structured memory bank to document the project comprehensively.

2. **Documentation Review**: Analyzed the existing codebase and documentation to create a complete picture of the project's architecture and functionality.

3. **Auto-End Feature Implementation**: Added functionality to automatically detect when a conversation has naturally concluded, rather than requiring a fixed number of turns.

## Next Steps

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improve error handling for edge cases, particularly around API failures and token limits.

2. **Additional Templates**: Expand the template library with more specialized conversation scenarios.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Identify and address any performance bottlenecks, particularly for long conversations.

4. **Testing Framework**: Develop comprehensive tests to ensure reliability across different usage patterns.

5. **Documentation Improvements**: Create more detailed API documentation and usage examples.

6. **Auto-End Feature Refinement**: Refine the conversation end detection algorithms to improve accuracy across different conversation types and topics.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **API Provider Flexibility**: Currently, the system is tightly coupled with Azure OpenAI. A future consideration is to make the API provider more flexible, allowing for other providers like OpenAI direct, Anthropic, etc.

2. **Memory Management**: The current in-memory approach works well for most use cases, but for longer conversations or persistent bots, a more robust storage solution might be needed.

3. **Template Management**: The current template system uses a static dictionary. A more dynamic approach might be beneficial for user-defined templates.

4. **Conversation Export Formats**: Currently supports HTML export. Additional formats like JSON, plain text, or CSV might be useful for different analysis needs.

5. **Auto-End Detection**: The current implementation uses a combination of farewell detection, repetition detection, and resolution detection. Future improvements could include more sophisticated semantic analysis or machine learning approaches.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Code Organization**: The project follows a modular approach with clear separation of concerns between the Chatbot, RolePlay, and Templates modules.

2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-except blocks are used to catch and log errors, particularly around API calls and file operations.

3. **Configuration Management**: Environment variables are used for API configuration, making it easy to deploy in different environments.

4. **Memory Structure**: Conversation memory is structured as a list of role-content pairs, following the format expected by the OpenAI API.

5. **Method Naming**: Private methods are prefixed with underscore (_), following Python conventions.

## Learnings and Project Insights

1. **API Integration Challenges**: Working with external APIs requires robust error handling and consideration of rate limits and token constraints.

2. **Conversation Flow Management**: Managing the flow of multi-turn conversations requires careful tracking of context and turn order.

3. **Template Design**: Creating effective templates requires balancing flexibility with ease of use.

4. **Memory Management Trade-offs**: In-memory storage provides speed but limits persistence, while file-based storage offers persistence but adds complexity.

5. **User Experience Considerations**: Even for a developer-focused tool, the API design significantly impacts the user experience.
