# Project Brief: SelfPlay

## Project Overview
SelfPlay is a Python package designed to simulate conversations between multiple chatbots. It enables developers to create and manage interactions between AI agents, with features for orchestrating conversation flow, maintaining memory, and exporting conversations.

## Core Requirements

1. **Multi-Bot Simulation**
   - Enable conversations between multiple chatbots
   - Support self-chat (a bot conversing with itself)
   - Allow for interaction between different bot personas

2. **Conversation Management**
   - Provide an orchestrator to determine response order
   - Support multi-turn conversations with configurable turn limits
   - Maintain conversation memory for context awareness

3. **Integration & Usability**
   - Offer an easy-to-use API for developers
   - Support Azure OpenAI integration
   - Enable conversation export in formatted HTML

4. **Extensibility**
   - Allow for custom bot personas through templates
   - Support various conversation scenarios through role templates

## Project Goals

1. Create a flexible framework for simulating AI conversations
2. Provide tools for testing and improving chatbot responses
3. Enable educational and research applications through role-play scenarios
4. Offer a simple yet powerful API for developers to integrate into their applications

## Success Criteria

1. Successfully simulate conversations between multiple bots
2. Maintain context across multi-turn conversations
3. Export conversations in a readable format
4. Support various predefined role templates
5. Provide comprehensive documentation and examples
