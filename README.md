## Usage

### Example 1: Multi-turn Self Chat with Azure OpenAI

In this example, the chatbot will perform a self-chat to simulate a conversation with itself using Azure OpenAI.

```python
import os
from selfplay.chatbot import Chatbot

# Set Azure OpenAI credentials
os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"
os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT"] = "https://your-endpoint.openai.azure.com"
os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION"] = "2023-12-01-preview"

# Self-chat multi-turn conversation
bot = Chatbot(
    name="default", 
    sys_msg="You are a helpful assistant and honest in responses. You give short and concise responses.",
    provider="azure",  # Using Azure OpenAI
    model="gpt-4"
)
bot.chat("What is the capital of California?")    
bot.chat("How about Oregon?")
bot.chat("How many people live here?")
print(bot)
```

### Example 2: Chat with Another Bot using OpenAI

In this example, two chatbots interact with each other using the OpenAI API.

```python
import os
from selfplay.chatbot import Chatbot

# Set OpenAI credentials
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-openai-api-key"

# Initialize chatbots with specific roles and system messages
teacher = Chatbot(
    name="Teacher",
    sys_msg="You are a helpful teacher with extensive knowledge of science and math. "
            "You ask thoughtful questions to motivate and invoke students' curiosity and depth. "
            "Provide concise, crisp, and clear replies.",
    provider="openai",  # Using OpenAI
    model="gpt-4"
)
student = Chatbot(
    name="Student",
    sys_msg="You are a student trying to learn from a teacher. "
            "Ask clarifying questions until the topic is clear to you.",
    provider="openai",  # Using OpenAI
    model="gpt-4"
)

# Interact between the teacher and student chatbots
response = teacher.interact(
    student,  # who to interact with
    start="I'm a 4th grader and I don't seem to quite understand what complex numbers are.",
    num_turns=2,  # max_turns in conversation
    filename="teacher-student.html"  # export the chat results in a well-formatted HTML file
)
print(response)
```

### Example 3: Using Anthropic Claude

```python
import os
from selfplay.chatbot import Chatbot

# Set Anthropic credentials
os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = "your-anthropic-api-key"

# Create a chatbot using Anthropic Claude
bot = Chatbot(
    name="Claude",
    sys_msg="You are Claude, a helpful and harmless AI assistant.",
    provider="anthropic",
    model="claude-3-opus"
)

response = bot.chat("Tell me about the history of artificial intelligence.")
print(response)
```

### Example 4: Using the Gradio UI

You can launch the Gradio UI to interact with the chatbots through a web interface:

```python
from selfplay.app_gradio import main

# Launch the Gradio app
main()
```

Alternatively, you can use the provided script:

```sh
python run_gradio.py
```

The UI allows you to:
- Select different LLM providers
- Configure API credentials
- Choose between Self-Chat, Bot-to-Bot Chat, and Template-Based Chat
- Customize bot personas and conversation parameters
- View and export conversation results
