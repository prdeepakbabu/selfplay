# Flu Shot A/B Test Analysis with Standard Personas

## Overview
This analysis examines the results of an A/B test comparing the effectiveness of two messages encouraging flu shot uptake, using standard personas instead of elite personas:

1. **Control (Standard Message)**: "Get your flu shot now! Will you get a flu shot?"
2. **Test (Social Proof Message)**: "78% of your neighborhood is protected through flushot. Get yours now to protect yourself from flu! Will you get a flu shot?"

The test was conducted with 50 standard personas from the PersonaHub dataset, with each persona answering both questions (within-subjects design). The temperature setting was 0.2 to ensure consistent responses.

## Results Summary
- **Control Group (Standard Message)**: 74.0% responded "Yes" (37/50)
- **Test Group (Social Proof Message)**: 72.0% responded "Yes" (36/50)
- **Lift from social proof**: -2.7% (slight negative impact)

## Comparison with Elite Personas Test
In our previous test with elite personas, we observed:
- **Control Group**: 76.0% responded "Yes" (38/50)
- **Test Group (with "4 of your neighbors" message)**: 72.0% responded "Yes" (36/50)
- **Lift**: -5.3%

The current test with standard personas and a stronger social proof message ("78% of your neighborhood") showed a smaller negative lift (-2.7% vs -5.3%), suggesting that:
1. The stronger percentage-based social proof message may be slightly more effective than the "4 neighbors" framing
2. The addition of the protection framing ("protect yourself from flu") may have slightly improved effectiveness
3. Standard personas may respond somewhat differently to social proof messaging than elite personas

## Detailed Analysis

### Control Group Responses
The control group, which received the direct message without social proof, showed a high acceptance rate of 74.0%. This group included:
- 37 personas who responded "Yes"
- 13 personas who responded "No"

The "Yes" responses came from a diverse range of personas, including medical professionals, educators, artists, and business professionals.

### Test Group Responses
The test group, which received the social proof message, showed a slightly lower acceptance rate of 72.0%. This group included:
- 36 personas who responded "Yes"
- 14 personas who responded "No"

### Gender Analysis
- **Control Group**: 80.0% of males (4/5) responded "Yes"
- **Test Group**: 80.0% of males (4/5) responded "Yes"

Note: The gender data was limited to only a small subset of personas, so these results should be interpreted with caution.

### Statistical Significance
Unfortunately, the McNemar's test for statistical significance could not be performed due to a technical issue with the scipy.stats module. However, given the small difference between the groups (just one persona), it's unlikely that the difference is statistically significant.

## Possible Explanations

### 1. Ceiling Effect
Both the control and test messages resulted in high acceptance rates (72-74%), suggesting a possible ceiling effect. Most personas may already be inclined to get a flu shot regardless of the messaging, leaving little room for improvement through social proof.

### 2. Message Framing
Despite using a stronger social proof message (78% vs 4 neighbors) and adding protection framing, the social proof message still did not outperform the simple direct message. This suggests that for flu shots, direct messaging may be more effective than social proof for this audience.

### 3. Persona Characteristics
The standard personas used in this test represent a wide range of professions and backgrounds, but they may still have characteristics that make them less susceptible to social proof messaging. Many of the personas are professionals who might make decisions based on their own knowledge rather than social influence.

### 4. Reactance Effect
Some personas might experience psychological reactance when presented with social proof, perceiving it as an attempt to manipulate their behavior, which could explain the slightly lower acceptance rate in the test group.

## Limitations
- The personas are fictional and may not perfectly represent real human decision-making
- The within-subjects design may introduce carryover effects
- Limited demographic data available for the standard personas
- Technical issue prevented statistical significance testing
- The standard personas have shorter descriptions than elite personas, which may affect the depth of persona simulation

## Recommendations for Future Tests
1. **Test different message framings**: Try messages that focus on personal benefits or expert recommendations rather than social proof
2. **Segment analysis**: Test different messaging strategies with different persona segments (e.g., healthcare professionals vs. general public)
3. **Combine social proof with other persuasion techniques**: Test messages that combine social proof with authority, scarcity, or reciprocity principles
4. **Test with real human participants**: Validate findings with real human participants to confirm if the patterns observed with AI personas hold true
5. **Fix technical issues**: Resolve the scipy.stats module issue to enable proper statistical significance testing

## Conclusion
This A/B test with standard personas showed a slight negative impact (-2.7%) of social proof on flu shot acceptance, which is less negative than the previous test with elite personas (-5.3%). While the stronger percentage-based social proof message and protection framing may have slightly improved effectiveness, the direct message still performed better overall.

These results suggest that for flu shot messaging, simple direct appeals may be more effective than social proof messages, at least for the types of personas represented in the PersonaHub dataset. However, the differences are small and may not be statistically significant.

The consistent pattern across both tests (with elite and standard personas) strengthens the conclusion that social proof may not be the most effective persuasion technique for flu shot messaging with these particular audiences.
